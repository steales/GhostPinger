## ⚠️Warning: File may be flagged as dangerous by your AntiVirus software⚠️
### This is simply becaquse of the nature of what it is - pingers will most likely be flagged as false positive (even if you make your own).

#### GhostPinger is a really simple IP Address pinger, probably accidentally skidded from somewhere.
Don't know why people make you pay for these - this took me about 5 minutes to make.
